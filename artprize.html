					<p class="">
						Have you ever wondered why music makes you want to move? It’s because nearly everyone is sensitive to the differences in the pace or structure of music. Even infants can detect differences in rhythmic patterns!
					</p>
					<p class="">
						How? Researchers are not completely sure, but they have found evidence of a network of brain regions that processes beats, and therefore helps us perceive rhythm. For example, two brain regions commonly associated with movement, the supplementary motor area (SMA) and the basal ganglia, are more active when listening to simple rhythms than complex rhythms. 
					</p>
					<p class="">
						I am investigating the brain’s preferences for rhythm by presenting chains of participants with rhythmic sequences, where the reproduced sequence of one participant serves as the input sequence for the next participant in the chain, and then analyzing whether the chain converges to a preferred pace or rhythmic structure.

						<strong>Methods</strong> <br>
						Similar to a game of telephone, each participant is presented with a rhythm that was previously reproduced by someone else, just like their reproduction is used as the input for the next participant. Therefore, each person’s reproduction influences the next rhythm that will be heard/seen and reproduced in the chain.
					</p>

					<p>
						This method is called serial reproduction and it has been used by psychologists as early as 1903, one of them being Sir Frederic Charles Bartlett, who used it to study how people’s memory for stories and pictures was shaped by their cultural experiences. 
					</p>

					<p>
						In one study, Bartlett presented his first participant in a chain with an Egyptian hieroglyph and asked him to reproduce it from memory. He then presented that reproduction to the next person in the chain and so on. With each subsequent reproduction, the hieroglyph started to resemble an owl and then became a cat. This was interpreted as a memory bias toward culturally familiar stimuli. In this case, people were more familiar with cats than with Egyptian hieroglyphs. 
					</p>

					<p>
						Likewise, in the case of rhythms, we should expect similar distortions because our brains have certain biases for rhythms we have experienced most often or are hard-wired to prefer.

					<p id="analysis">
						<strong>Analysis</strong> <br>
						To analyze this data, I will use a mathematical model that will quantify how each reproduction in the chain distorts the information that is passed from person to person. Specifically, this model will characterize each person’s prior experiences and expectations in the form of a prior probability distribution that describes how some things in the world are more likely than other things.
					</p>

					<p>
						In the case of rhythm, the most probable rhythms are the ones we have experienced most often or that our brains are hard-wired to prefer. When we hear and then have to remember a rhythm, our memories are imperfect. We fill in the blanks with the most likely option — that is, we draw from our prior distributions to strengthen our memories. When enough people do this who have similar experiences and expectations, each passage through a reproduction in the chain will nudge the rhythm closer and closer to what we expect, regardless of what the starting point was. 
					</p>

					<p>
						Thus, several reproductions later, the final rhythm will converge on a standard preferred tempo or preferred meter, allowing us to infer the brain’s assignment of probabilities to possible rhythms in the world.

						<a href="http://kimboluti.wordpress.com">Elisa Kim Fromboluti</a> is a graduate student in the <a href="http://taplab.psy.msu.edu/">Timing, Attention, and Perception lab</a> at Michigan State University in East Lansing, MI. Working with Dr. Devin McAuley, she studies how the brain uses and responds to timing and rhythmic cues in the environment, such as those found in speech and music.
