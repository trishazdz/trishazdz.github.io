            I am a masters student in human-computer interaction design at Indiana University. 
          </p>


          <p>
            I believe in human-centered design. I address the core rather than the surface. I respect craftsmanship in design, as well as the process of doing and making. I design against unnecessary complexity.  
          </p>

          <p>
            I studied psychology in college, and assisted with various research projects investigating human cognition. At the same time, I spent a lot of time working with data: managing, cleaning, organizing, exploring, analyzing, and visualizing it. In those days, I wanted to present information so that anyone could understand it—not just the experts. This desire for usability and understandability spread to other domains, and led to my discovery of human-centered design.
